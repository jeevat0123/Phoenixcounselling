    serviceContent: 'In a couple counseling session, a therapist helps the partners address relationship issues by providing a safe, neutral space for open communication. The session typically involves identifying and understanding negative patterns among the couple, improving communication skills, and developing strategies to resolve their conflicts. Initially, the therapist works individually with both partners. The therapist facilitates discussions to help both partners express their feelings and needs, fostering empathy and understanding. Techniques such as role-playing, active listening, and problem-solving exercises are often used to strengthen relationship and promote healthier interactions. Additionally, the therapist may assign homework to practice new skills, explore underlying issues affecting the relationship, and set goals for future sessions to track progress and ensure continuous improvement and help the couple to work strategically both on their individual and common goals.',

    whatHappensContent: 'Couple therapy starts with an early assessment phase where the journey begins with the therapist understanding what brings them to therapy. Couples experience difficulties in many areas such as; emotional connection, intimacy and sexual intimacy, finances, social interactions, household, children and upbringing etc. Post a brief understanding, the area of concerns is further evaluated by getting separate accounts (this ensures objectivity) from both the people involved to delve deeper and see how each one is thinking and feeling. This sets stage for explicit expression of emotions and expectations in a safe space. Once the assessment is complete, interventions may vary depending on the concerns presented and the therapist‚Äôs evaluation of the goals set collaboratively with the couple. The therapist may also choose to do individual conversations as required to help enhance the relationship. ',
