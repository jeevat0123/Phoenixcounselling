                Family counseling, also known as family therapy, is a form of psychotherapy designed to help families
                improve communication, resolve conflicts, and strengthen their relationships. It involves working with
                multiple family members to address issues that impact the entire family unit, such as behavioral
                problems in children, mental health conditions, substance abuse, and marital conflicts. The therapy is
                collaborative, involving all relevant family members, and aims to create a supportive environment where
                everyone can express their thoughts and feelings openly. Through various techniques and interventions,
                family counseling enhances understanding and empathy, providing tools for effective communication and
                problem-solving, ultimately leading to stronger, healthier family dynamics.

                    Ideally, all immediate family members should participate in family counseling to address the

                    be involved, depending on the specific issues being addressed.

                    Family counseling sessions are generally confidential, but the exact confidentiality policies may
                    vary depending on the therapist or counseling center. The therapist will typically discuss
                    confidentiality with the family during the initial session and outline any exceptions, such as
                    situations involving safety concerns or legal requirements. It's important to establish trust and
                    open communication with the therapist regarding privacy concerns.
